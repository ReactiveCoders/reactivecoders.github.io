To remember:

* Jekyll looks good.

Probably what I need for a simple site.
jekyll serve -port 8080

* Ruby

Requirement ruby (least 1.9) + ruby dev.

Very useful **rvm** for installing latest Ruby.

Great tutorial [Install Ruby on CentOS 6](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-centos-6-with-rvm)
