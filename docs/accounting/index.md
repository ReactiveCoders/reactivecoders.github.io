##Balance sheet
Assets=Liabilities

FA + CA = O/F + LTL + CL

Where :

- FA = Fixed assets = Intangibles + Net fixes assets + Long-term investments
- CA = Inventories(stocks) + Accounts receivable + Cash + Miscellaneous
- CL = Current liabilities = Account payables(creditors) + Short-term loans + Miscellaneous
